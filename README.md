Hi!
I'm 3xt and I'm a programmer. 
I create forums and games.

Okey, let`s jump to the game.

- This game is in rpg category.
  I mean, there you have typical rpg things (mobs, misions, game currency etc)

  Easy to make. And if someone wants to make your own game, then he can just download src :D

  If you are worried the exe is not clear, just download src :D
